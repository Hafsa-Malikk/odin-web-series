    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Cook ramen noodles, reserving
        seasoning packets, in boiling water until softened, about 3 minutes.
        Drain noodles and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a small skillet. Cook and stir beaten
        eggs in hot oil until scrambled and firm. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 1 teaspoon vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook
        and stir green onions in hot oil until softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove
        green onions to a plate; set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat remaining 1 teaspoon vegetable oil in the same skillet over medium
        heat. Cook and stir carrots, peas, and bell pepper separately until
        softened, removing each to the plate with green onions when done.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine 2 tablespoons sesame oil with remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable
        oil in the same large skillet or a wok over medium heat. Fry cooked
        noodles in hot sesame-vegetable oil, tossing frequently, until golden, 3
        to 5 minutes. Season with desired amounts of sesame oil, soy sauce, and
        reserved ramen seasoning packets; toss to coat. Stir in cooked
        vegetables, tossing frequently, until heated through, about 5 more
        minutes.
